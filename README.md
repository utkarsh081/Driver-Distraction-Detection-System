# ðŸš— Driver Distraction Detection System (Real-Time AI-Powered Safety Tool)

A real-time AI-powered system built by **Utkarsh Pandey** to identify and classify distracted driver behaviors using computer vision and deep learning. This project aims to enhance road safety by actively monitoring driver activity and warning against risky behavior.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does

This system uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (based on ResNet50) to detect **10 different types of distracted driving behaviors** using live webcam feed. It runs a Flask-based web application with a real-time video interface and delivers instant predictions.

## ðŸ“¸ Distraction Classes Detected

- `c0`: Safe driving
- `c1`: Texting - right hand
- `c2`: Talking on phone - right hand
- `c3`: Texting - left hand
- `c4`: Talking on phone - left hand
- `c5`: Operating the radio
- `c6`: Drinking
- `c7`: Reaching behind
- `c8`: Hair or makeup
- `c9`: Talking to a passenger
